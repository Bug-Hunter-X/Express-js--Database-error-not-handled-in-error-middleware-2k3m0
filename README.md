# Express.js Error Handling Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: failing to properly handle database errors within custom error handling middleware.  The bug involves a situation where a database query fails but the error isn't caught by the app's error handler, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The solution implements robust error handling to address this issue and provide a more user-friendly experience.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js app that fetches user data from a database (simulated here). If the database query fails (e.g., user not found), the error is not correctly caught by the error middleware.  This results in the application not responding appropriately. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It ensures that database-related errors are caught within the custom error handling middleware. This prevents unexpected behavior and provides a more graceful response to the user. This is particularly useful for production applications where these kind of errors may lead to crashes if not carefully addressed.
